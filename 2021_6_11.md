# Started HANGHAE99 from monday
This will be my first, enthusiastic team projects.
did not participate things like these before.
But I had to pay by myself. It makes me feel like more bury myself more.

- I am a developer
- I am a perfect one
- I will be the proud one.

finished [MO:PEN](https://github.com/Hanghae99-Team34-1stWeek/miniProject.git) project with 3 other crews.
They were so nice and kind.
But i did not get all of codes from the project especially register/login part.
I will try better next time.

Gonna finish algorithm lecture W01, W02 today.

I feel great!üëç
